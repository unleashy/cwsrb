Cwsrb is a simple API wrapper for [ConWorkShop](http://conworkshop.com).

## Dependencies

* Ruby 2.1+

## Installation

Check the [Development section](https://github.com/unleashy/cwsrb). I'll probably put this in [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org) later.

## Usage

... TODO ...

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Contributing

The gem is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
